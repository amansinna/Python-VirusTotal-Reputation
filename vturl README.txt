Script usage: python vturl.py [input file]

Couple notes:
1.	You also still need to have the csv module. This uses the same shell as the other VT script I wrote you, so in your input file can have leading/trailing spaces or newlines, it won’t matter. I don’t do any input validation on whether the line is a proper URL or domain, however, since it’s kind of pointless to do so here. 
2.	As discussed, VT will pull an existing scan report for the URL if it has it; if it doesn’t the script will request a new scan (see pic above). It’ll wait 20 seconds to let VT finish scanning (up to 3 times for a total of one minute) before giving up and moving on. If you’d like to modify the counts just change the 3 in line 56: “result = vt_url_lookup(url, 3)” to something else, or if you want each iteration of waiting to be different change in the 20 in line 32: “time.sleep(20)” to something else. Kind of just took a guess here, probably depends on the site to be scanned.
3.	If you want a script that forces a new scan and returns those results, let me know and we can make a different one for that purpose.
4.	Filename will include yearmonth_24hrtime, so feel free to run it multiple times even with the old data file open – it will create a new file as long as a minute has passed.
5.	Last column “Errors” should generally be empty, but if something goes wrong an explanation will be there instead of stopping the script. Some are meant to be user friendly – like HTTP 404 or similar, other times may be raw error output from Python and not very friendly. Let me know if you need help deciphering
